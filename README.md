# Lab 3 - Grove Temperature and Humidity Sensor Experiment 
## Introduction
The temperature and humidity sensor provides a pre-calibrated digital output. This example covers the low cost DHT temperature & humidity sensors. The DHT sensors are made of two parts: a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor. There is also a very basic chip inside that does some analog to digital conversion and provides a digital signal with the temperature and humidity data. The digital signal is fairly easy to read using any microcontroller.

Replace the default code with the code in "main.cpp" from this GitHub repo by creating an empty project OR clone the GitHub code in to your Keil Studio Cloud IDE (recommended).

## Dependencies
- NXP FRDM K64F development board
